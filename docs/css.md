# Color
HSL(Hue, Saturation and Lightness) color (new in CSS3)
* Hue - the technical term that describes what we understand as "color". It can take on values between 0 and 360.
* Saturation - the amount of gray in a given color (0% to 100%). 0% represents a shade of gray, 100% represents full saturation.
* Lightness - the amount of white in a given color (0% to 100%). 0% represents black, 50% is normal and 100% represents white.

`rgba` can be used to set opacity of a color, while the `a` should be a number between 0 and 1, inclusive. For example, `rgba(123, 88, 9, 0.5)`

1. Serif - the letters in these fonts have extra details on the ends of each letter. Examples include fonts like `Times New Roman` or `Georgia`.
2. Sans-Serif - the letters in these fonts do not have extra details on the ends of each letter. Instead, letters have straight, flat edges. For example, `Arial` or `Helvetica`.
